    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Why are there two parts to the pricing?",
        "answer": "Your monthly plan (£75-£150) covers your core online presence—website, systems, setup, and unlimited support. Plus and Pro plans also include AI and communication services (calls, SMS) which are charged based on actual usage, so you only pay for what you use."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much will usage fees actually cost me?",
        "answer": "It depends on your call and message volume. Most Pro plan businesses spend £12-15/month on usage. Plus plan businesses typically spend £4-6/month. Essential has no usage fees. We show detailed rates and examples on this page so you can estimate your costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any hidden fees or surprise charges?",
        "answer": "No. Your monthly plan price is fixed. Usage fees (Plus and Pro only) are charged based on actual consumption with transparent per-unit pricing shown below. No setup fees, no surprise charges, no hidden costs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is there a 12-month commitment?",
        "answer": "We invest significant upfront work—custom website design, system integrations, AI training (Pro), review automation setup (Plus/Pro), and comprehensive training. A 12-month commitment allows us to deliver this properly. After 12 months, it becomes rolling month-to-month."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel after 12 months?",
        "answer": "Yes! After your initial 12 months, it's rolling month-to-month. Cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. You keep your domain and business data. The website is removed as source code remains our property. With 98% retention, most clients stay long-term."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's actually included in my monthly price?",
        "answer": "Everything! Complete setup, custom website, hosting, security, unlimited content updates, unlimited support in Thai and English, regular updates, and all features in your chosen plan. The only extras are usage fees for AI and communication services (Plus and Pro)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
        "answer": "Yes! Existing customers can upgrade anytime (month-to-month, no new commitment). Downgrades are possible after your initial 12-month period. We'll help you find the right fit as your business grows."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm in a different country?",
        "answer": "Essential and Plus plans are available in most countries. The Pro plan (which includes AI receptionist phone services) is currently available in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia, and Germany due to phone system limitations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer discounts for annual payment?",
        "answer": "Not currently. Our pricing is already highly competitive for fully-managed service. All plans are billed monthly, and you get the same great service regardless of how you pay."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes this better value than doing it myself or hiring an agency?",
        "answer": "DIY tools require your time, technical knowledge, and constant maintenance. Agencies charge £2,000-5,000+ monthly. We're the middle ground—professional, fully-managed service at £75-£150/month. You get agency-quality results without agency prices or DIY complexity."
