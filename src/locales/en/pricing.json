    "text": "Common questions about pricing, commitment, and what you're actually paying for.",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Why are there two parts to the pricing?",
        "answer": "Your monthly plan covers the core stuff. Website, systems, setup, unlimited support. The Plus and Pro plans also include AI and communication services like calls and SMS. Those get charged based on what you actually use, so you're not paying for things you don't need."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much will usage fees actually cost me?",
        "answer": "Honestly, less than most people expect. Pro plan businesses typically spend around £12-15 a month on usage. Plus plan is usually £4-6. Essential has no usage fees at all. We've got detailed rates further down this page if you want to work out a rough estimate."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any hidden fees or surprise charges?",
        "answer": "None. Your monthly plan price is fixed. Usage fees on Plus and Pro are charged based on what you actually use, with clear per-unit pricing. No setup fees tucked away somewhere, no surprises on your bill three months in."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is there a 12-month commitment?",
        "answer": "There's a lot of work upfront on our end. Custom website design, getting all the systems talking to each other, training the AI if you're on Pro, setting up review automation. A 12-month commitment gives us the space to do all of that properly. After the first year, it switches to rolling month-to-month."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel after 12 months?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Once your first year is done, you're free to leave anytime with 30 days notice. You keep your domain and your business data. The website itself gets taken down since the source code stays with us. That said, most people stick around. Our retention rate is somewhere around 98%."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's actually included in my monthly price?",
        "answer": "Everything you need. Complete setup, custom website, hosting, security, unlimited content updates, unlimited support in Thai and English, regular system updates, and all the features in your chosen plan. The only extras are usage fees for AI and communication services if you're on Plus or Pro."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
        "answer": "You can upgrade whenever you like, no new commitment required. Downgrades are possible once you've finished your initial 12 months. We're happy to help you figure out what makes sense as your business changes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I'm in a different country?",
        "answer": "Essential and Plus work pretty much everywhere. Pro is a bit more limited because of the phone system side of things. Right now it's available in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia, and Germany. We're working on expanding that."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer discounts for annual payment?",
        "answer": "Not at the moment. The pricing is already pretty competitive for a fully managed service like this. Everything bills monthly and you get the same level of support either way."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes this better value than doing it myself or hiring an agency?",
        "answer": "Going the DIY route means buying and learning a bunch of separate tools. Website builder, booking software, review platform, voucher system, AI receptionist. That's five different logins, five monthly bills, and a lot of hours spent figuring things out when they break. Agencies are expensive and most of them are focused on running ads, not building systems. We built one thing that does everything, and we manage it completely. You focus on your clients, we handle the rest."
